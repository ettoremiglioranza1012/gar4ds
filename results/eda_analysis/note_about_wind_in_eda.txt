1. The "Wind Anomaly": 

Observation: The aggregate correlation of +0.19 is indeed a "mathematical artifact" 

that masks two opposing physical phenomena happening at different heights.

Breaking down your correlation table confirms the "Transport vs. Dispersion" hypothesis:

At the Surface (10m): Dispersion

wind_v_10m (North-South wind): r=−0.226 (Negative).

Physics: In Alpine valleys, North-South winds act as a ventilation system. 

They physically sweep pollution out of the valley. This behaves exactly as expected: More Wind = Less PM10.

At Upper Levels (850hPa, approx. 1500m): Transport & Trapping 

uwind_850 (West-East wind): r=+0.238 (Positive).

Physics: This is the critical finding. Strong Westerly winds aloft are associated with higher surface PM10.

Why? This indicates "Synoptic Forcing." 

Strong upper-level winds might be transporting aged pollution masses over the region, 

or they may be associated with large-scale weather systems (like warm fronts) that cap the valleys, preventing vertical mixing.

Strategic Conclusion: We cannot use a single "Wind Speed" variable. We must include the vertical layers separately in the regression.

Surface Winds will model local cleaning. Upper Winds will model regional transport/trapping.




2. Based on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) log you provided, the terrain distinction ("Mountain/Valley" vs. "Plain") 

is not derived from actual elevation data.

Instead, it is derived using a simplified latitude proxy.

Evidence from the Log

The EDA log explicitly states the methodology in section 2.1 Station Classification by Terrain:

"⚠ No elevation data in metadata. Classifying by latitude as proxy:" "Note: This is a simplified classification" 

How it Works

Since the station metadata (stations_metadata.geojson) lacked an altitude column, the script likely applied a simple geometric rule:

North of a certain latitude: Classified as Mountain/Valley (capturing the Alpine stations in Trentino/South Tyrol like BZ4, BZ5).

South of a certain latitude: Classified as Plain (capturing the Po Valley stations like ARPAL from Lombardy).

Physical Validation

Despite being a rough proxy, the classification appears physically sound based on your results:

Wind Speed: The "Plain" stations show significantly higher median wind speeds 

(~1.0 m/s) compared to "Mountain/Valley" stations (~0.3 m/s). 

This aligns with the physical reality that open plains experience higher winds than enclosed alpine valleys
