Analysis Date: 2026-02-06 12:08:09

1. TEMPERATURE
   Issue: high_correlation
   Reason: High correlation (|r| > 0.85)
   Variables to remove: temperature_550, temperature_2m, temperature_850

2. TEMPERATURE
   Issue: high_dimensionality
   Reason: PCA shows redundancy in dimensions
   Dimension reduction: 4 → 2

3. U_WIND
   Issue: high_dimensionality
   Reason: PCA shows redundancy in dimensions
   Dimension reduction: 4 → 3

4. V_WIND
   Issue: high_dimensionality
   Reason: PCA shows redundancy in dimensions
   Dimension reduction: 4 → 3

5. SURFACE
   Issue: high_dimensionality
   Reason: PCA shows redundancy in dimensions
   Dimension reduction: 4 → 3
